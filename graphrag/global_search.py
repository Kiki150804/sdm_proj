"""Map-reduce global answering over community summaries.

Map: every community summary at the chosen level is turned into a partial
answer with a 0-100 helpfulness score. With Gemini, the LLM writes the
partial answer and rates it, as in the paper; offline, the score comes from
TF-IDF relevance and the partial answer is the best-matching summary
sentences. Partial answers scoring 0 are dropped.

Reduce: the remaining partial answers are sorted by score, packed into a
context budget, and combined into one global answer (by Gemini, or as a
list of themes offline).

Every community with at least `min_size` entities is mapped (smaller ones
only get extractive summaries anyway), and the reduce context budget
(`max_chars`) matches the vector RAG baseline's context (~5 chunks, ~27k
characters), so both systems answer from the same amount of text.
